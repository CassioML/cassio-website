Firstly, thank you for your interest in contributing to CassIO! We are excited to have you on board. If you want to help with a code contribution, our project uses Python and follows [Pythonic code style](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/). If you don't feel ready to make a code contribution yet, no problem! You can also check out the [website issues](https://github.com/CassioML/cassio-website/issues).
This guide provides a brief overview of how you can contribute to the project.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

Ensure you have git installed on your system. If you don't, follow these instructions to get started.
Fork the CassIO repository to your GitHub account by clicking the 'Fork' button on the top-right of [https://github.com/CassioML](https://github.com/CassioML).

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

After forking the repository, clone it to your local machine with the following command. Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CassioML.git
```

### Step 3: Create a New Branch

It's important to create a new branch for each feature or fix you're working on. This keeps your changes organized and separated from the master branch. You can create and switch to a new branch by using the following command. Replace `branch-name` with the name of your branch:

```bash
git checkout -b branch-name
```

### Step 4: Make Your Changes

Now you're ready to make your changes! Ensure you follow the project's coding standards and guidelines.

### Step 5: Commit and Push Your Changes

Once you've made your changes, you can add them to a commit with:

```bash
git add .
```

Then, commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "Your detailed commit message"
```

Finally, push your changes to your GitHub account with:

```bash
git push origin branch-name
```

### Step 6: Submit a Pull Request

Go back to your forked repo on GitHub and click on 'Compare & pull request'. Fill in the necessary details and click on 'Create pull request'.

## Code of Conduct

While contributing, please respect the opinions and guidelines of others. Any form of harassment or inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated.
