# API Setup

### Credentials file

In the repo root directory, create file `.api_keys` by copying
`.api_keys.template` and insert your valid credentials.

!!! note Available LLM Services

    Depending on which API Keys you define in the file,
    a different provider will be used as the source of
    the LLMs.

    Currently, only OpenAI is supported.

### Everything is set

Well done: you can now browse the website and run the code examples!
