# LangChain, partialing prompt templates

Often you may want to "partial" a prompt template, i.e. to supply _some_
of the arguments to the template to get a new template which is ready to
be formatted into a ready-to-use prompt once just the remaining arguments
are given.

This can be done with the Cassandra-specific prompt templates.
