# Vector Search

This section shows what `cassIO` is offering to support
the "Vector Search" capabilities.

These are being added to Cassandra (CEP-30) and,
at the time of writing, have not yet made it to `trunk`.
For this reason, at the moment you have two options:

- Use [DataStax Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com/), a serverless DBaaS built on Apache Cassandra. You can get a free account and just start using it in a few minutes.
- Build the Cassandra binaries from the source and run it yourself locally. [This page](/local_db_setup) offers a guide on how to do that.
