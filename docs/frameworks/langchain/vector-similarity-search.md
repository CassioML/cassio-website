# Vector Similarity Search

This section shows what `cassIO` is offering to support
easy usage of the "Vector Similarity Search" capabilities.

These are being added to Cassandra (CEP-30) and,
at the time of writing, have not yet made it to `trunk`.

While the LangChain wrappers is expected to remain
reasonably stable, the internals (e.g. the cassIO
implementation, or the CQL syntax used therein) are probably going
to change quite a bit.

Please refrain from using these capabilities in a production environment
for a little while more.
