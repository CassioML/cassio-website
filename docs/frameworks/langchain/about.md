# About LangChain

[LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) is a popular and rapidly evolving
framework to automate most of the management of and interaction with large language
models: among its features are support for memory, vector-based similarity search,
an advanced prompt templating abstraction and much more.

LangChain comes with a Python and a Javascript implementation. This section
targets the Python version.
