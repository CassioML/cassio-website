      "The human asks the AI to tell them about William Tell, the hero. The AI explains that William Tell was a legendary Swiss hero from the late 13th or early 14th century, who is most known for shooting an apple off his son's head with a crossbow as an act of defiance against a tyrannical Austrian ruler. The human then jokes about any relation to the apple from Cupertino, to which the AI responds that it is highly unlikely given the timeline of their respective histories. The human then shifts the conversation to starfish, to which the AI explains that they are a group of echinoderms found in all the world's oceans. The AI also mentions that some species of starfish, such as the crown-of-thorns starfish, can be invasive and destructive to coral reef ecosystems.\n"
