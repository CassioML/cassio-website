      "AI:  Sure! Starfish are a type of echinoderm that are found in all the world's oceans. They have a radial symmetry and a soft body that is divided into five or more sections. Starfish can range in size from small 1-inch long species to large species that can measure up to 3 feet across. They feed on mollusks, crustaceans, and other small organisms, and some species are even capable of regenerating a new arm if one is lost or damaged.\n",
