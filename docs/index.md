## Welcome to CassIO

Do you want to use Apache Cassandra with your ML/LLM/GenAI workloads,
and **do you want to start NOW**?

This is the place for you.

## Site content

Don't just browse the website: you should clone the [repository](https://github.com/cassioML/cassio-website)
and start running the code examples yourself (notebooks, tutorials, full-fledged small applications).
You'll find everything in the `examples/` directory.

### General pre-requisites

Most code examples require a Cassandra / Astra DB database.
In the [general setup instructions](/db_setup), we show how to create a free Astra DB instance,
but of course you can use any Cassandra installation, provided you adapt
the few lines of code that connect to your database.

### Specific setup

We will cover Cassandra integration with several ML-centric tools and frameworks:
each will live in a subdirectory of `examples/` and will have its own
setup instructions (covering e.g. creation of the adequate Python environment).
These will be given at the top of each section in this website.
