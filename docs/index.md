## Welcome to CassIO

Do you want to use [Apache CassandraÂ®](https://cassandra.apache.org) with your ML/LLM/GenAI workloads,
and **do you want to start NOW**?

This is the place for you.

## How to use this site

Don't just browse the website: you should clone the [repository](https://github.com/cassioML/cassio-website)
and start running the code examples yourself (notebooks, tutorials, full-fledged small applications).
You'll find everything in this repo.

### General pre-requisites

Most code examples require a Cassandra / Astra DB database.
In the [general setup instructions](/db_setup), we show how to create a free Astra DB instance out of convenience,
but of course you can use any Cassandra installation, provided you adapt
the few lines of code that connect to your database.

!!! info "Experimental Cassandra features"

    Some of the features rely on the "Vector Similarity Search"
    capabilities, which are being added to Cassandra and are not yet
    merged to the released versions.

    In order to start experimenting with them, at the moment, you need to
    build the binary yourself from the source and start an instance locally.

    Refer to the [Local DB Setup](/local_db_setup) for instructions. This notice will be
    lifted as the feature will be shipped with Cassandra.

Similarly, many of the examples need access to a third-party
service for LLMs and embeddings (for instance, Google's Vertex AI or OpenAI):
make sure you follow the [API setup](/api_setup) to configure the
necessary API Keys and other secrets for your provider of choice.

### Per-framework specific setup

We cover Cassandra integrations with several ML-centric tools and frameworks:
for each of them (a section of the site), there is a subdirectory with
explanations and examples. The code there is stand-alone, provided you
did the general setup (see above): but usually you have first to
go through a framework-specific setup (covering e.g. the setup
of a suitable Python environment with the right dependencies),
described at the top of the section.

!!! example

    If you want to run the sample code for [LangChain](/frameworks/langchain/about/) follow these steps:

    1. clone [this repo](https://github.com/cassioML/cassio-website);
    2. do the [general DB setup](/db_setup);
    3. do the [local DB setup](/local_db_setup) if you want to use the Vector Search capabilities;
    4. do the [API setup](/api_setup);
    5. do the [LangChain-specific setup](/frameworks/langchain/setup/).

    At this point you can fire up Jupyter notebook and start running any of the
    provided notebooks.
    When moving on to testing another framework, only the last step will be needed.
