!!! warning "Discontinued as a public library"

        Starting March 2024, efforts to improve CassIO are put on hold. The library,
        while still used as is within other projects and receiving occasional updates,
        is now essentially **discontinued** for use by the general public.

```bash
pip install cassio
```
